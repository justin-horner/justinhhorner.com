## Welcome
Today I'm announcing a new series; Intro to C++

My plan for this blog is to discuss the development of games, game engines and related tools.
In order to easily follow along with these topics, I believe it's important to have some level of understanding and familiarity with C++.

## Plan
There are plenty of C++ learning resources, but in true developer fashion, I've decided to write an entire series on the subject.

My plan for the series is to stay strictly within the domain of the C++ language while including some exercises that are based on game concepts to keep it interesting and relevant.

All code examples should be cross-platform, which means that regardless if you use Windows, Linux or macOS, you'll be able to follow along. These program will be text-based and executed on the command line, and as such I will not be covering 2D/3D graphics (I may start a new series to cover those topics one day).

## Support
If you want to support the blog along the way, all I ask is that you share it with others. If there's a topic you want me to cover, feel free to let me know on [Twitter/X](https://x.com/justinhhorner) or drop by on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/justinhhorner) during a live stream.

Thank you for your time and interest.
Take care.
